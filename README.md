# Practical-Malware-Analysis
Write up for PMA labs solution
## CHAPTER 1
### Lab 1-1
#### Questions
1. Upload the files to http://www.VirusTotal.com/ and view the reports. Does
either file match any existing antivirus signatures?
2. When were these files compiled?
3. Are there any indications that either of these files is packed or obfuscated?
If so, what are these indicators?
4. Do any imports hint at what this malware does? If so, which imports
are they?
5. Are there any other files or host-based indicators that you could look for
on infected systems?
6. What network-based indicators could be used to find this malware on
infected machines?
7. What would you guess is the purpose of these files?
#### Solution
1- These files were written specifically for this book, so as of this writing,
you should not find a signature for them on VirusTotal.com. Of course, if
these files become part of the antivirus signatures as a result of the publi-
cation of this book, the results will be different.

2-Both files were compiled on December 19, 2010, within 1 minute of each other.
